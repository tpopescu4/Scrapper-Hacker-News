scrapping from html and filtering

with the use of two libraries we will get the html from the url
and then save it so we can use it
after getting only the information needed we save it on a list of titles, points and comments
then on a list of objects so we can put together the rank, title and point of each new
and to finish we separate in two different lists the titles with more than 5 words and print the information
